# Blackjack Game

This is a simple implementation of the Blackjack card game in Python. The game is played in the console, where you can compete against a computer opponent.

## Features

- The game allows a player to draw cards, calculate scores, and compare them with the computer's score.
- The player can decide whether to draw more cards or pass.
- The game automatically determines the winner based on the rules of Blackjack.

## Files

- **main.py**: This is the main file that contains the game logic, including functions to deal cards, calculate scores, and determine the winner.
- **art.py**: This file contains ASCII art that is displayed when the game starts.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
2. The game will display your initial cards and the first card of the computer.
3. You can choose to draw another card or pass.
4. The computer will draw cards automatically based on its score.
5. The winner is determined based on the final scores.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required as the game only uses Python's built-in modules.

## Running the Game

To start playing, simply run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
